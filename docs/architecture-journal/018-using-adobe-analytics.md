# ADR 018: Using Adobe Analytics

27 March 2023

## Context

This project is a cross-disciplinary effort dreamt up by Alicia Midland (Analytics & Optimization Team) and Kristine Horn (Engineering Team) of the WT Durham Office. The initial intent of this application is to serve as a learning tool to inform both practices how we can more easily integrate analytics alongside the development of application features. With all of this in mind, it is important to note what projects are best suited to use Adobe Analytics:

- Organizations using Adobe Experience Cloud
- Organizations that want an expensive, enterprise-feeling solution
- Great to consider for web implementations

It is important to collaborate with your WT Analytics & Optimization team members for more details.

## Decision

We will be using Adobe Analytics in this project as a demonstration of it's capabilities in an E-commerce app.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

While this tool is intended for learning purposes it is good to note what projects Adobe Analytics is not suited for:

- Organizations that can't handle a complex implementation and maintenance
- Price-conscious organizations or those that need a free option

- Not ideal for clients with a wide ecosystem of mobile applications
