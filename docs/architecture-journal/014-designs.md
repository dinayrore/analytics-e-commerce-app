# ADR 010: Designs

21 March 2023

## Context

Designs are the vision for the user interface (UI) and the seamless interaction of the user experience (UX). While the initial intent for this project is to prioritize analytics, once we have integrated all of our analytic tooling - Mixpanel, Amplitude, GA4, & Adobe Analytics - we will shift focus on improving the project styles to match our [Designs](https://www.figma.com/file/Cjfl5k6W2bWSjQcnwClTIG/Analytics-Sandbox-E-commerce-App?node-id=0%3A1&t=bfguxj0dM0MHlhbm-1).

Doug Ransdell has begun design work for our project - creating our application logo and building out several frames within a Figma file.

Leigh Bryant has offered to work on designing for accessibility.

Aligning on common nomenclature for component structure and parts therein for both our designs and our application code will strengthen our ability to communicate as a team.

## Decision

We will use the designs provided to improve the look and feel (UI/UX) of the React Native Expo E-commerce app.
We will use agreed upon terminology to align with one another and strengthen our ability to communicate application needs across disciplines.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

This entire project is built upon having the time to work on designs and features. There is no dedicated team. However, if we stick to our guidelines here, this tool can serve it's most fundamental purpose for learning new things, as well as strengthen our cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration efforts.
