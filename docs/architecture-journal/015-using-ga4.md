# ADR 015: Using GA4

27 March 2023

## Context

This project is a cross-disciplinary effort dreamt up by Alicia Midland (Analytics & Optimization Team) and Kristine Horn (Engineering Team). The initial intent of this application is to serve as a learning tool to inform both practices how we can more easily integrate analytics alongside the development of application features. With all of this in mind, it is important to note what projects are best suited to use GA4:

- Organizations which are all in with Google's Marketing Suite - Google Ads, DVF360, Google Optimize. For these organizations, GA4 is the simplest integration to their existing Google platforms.
- Marketing teams or integrated marketing/product teams.

It is important to collaborate with your Analytics & Optimization team members for more details.

## Decision

We will be using GA4 in this project as a demonstration of it's capabilities in an E-commerce app.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

While this tool is intended for learning purposes it is good to note what projects GA4 is not suited for:

- Organizations operating in the EU
- Dedicated product analytics/UX teams
