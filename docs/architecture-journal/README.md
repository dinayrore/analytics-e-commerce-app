# Architecture Journal

A detailed account of the technical decision making for React Native analytic sandbox applications. 

Inspired by the process documented in this [blog post](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), as practiced by and originated with the HCV WT team. Documenting the why, how, and what came about from a technical decision proves a a useful reference for those who are new and wish to contribute and even returning veterans for a project/process.

To contribute, begin with the [template](000-architecture-decision-record-template.md). Create a new file with a serially-incrementing record number and commit it to this directory.
