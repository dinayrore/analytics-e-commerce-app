# ADR 017: Using Mixpanel

27 March 2023

## Context

This project is a cross-disciplinary effort dreamt up by Alicia Midland (Analytics & Optimization Team) and Kristine Horn (Engineering Team) of the WT Durham Office. The initial intent of this application is to serve as a learning tool to inform both practices how we can more easily integrate analytics alongside the development of application features. With all of this in mind, it is important to note what projects are best suited to use Mixpanel:

- Business-to-employee (B2E) products due to robust user profile features.
- Self-service product teams
- Organizations that need a dedicated customer success team
- Organizations looking for straight up product analytics (nothing additional)

It is important to collaborate with your WT Analytics & Optimization team members for more details.

## Decision

We will be using Mixpanel in this project as a demonstration of it's capabilities in an E-commerce app.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

While this tool is intended for learning purposes it is good to note what projects Mixpanel is not suited for:

- Organizations that are primarily interested in marketing/sales analytics or attribution vs product analytics
- Organizations that need full-service tool with bells and whistles (CDP or A/B testing)
