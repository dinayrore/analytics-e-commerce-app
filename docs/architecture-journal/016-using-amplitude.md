# ADR 016: Using Amplitude

27 March 2023

## Context

This project is a cross-disciplinary effort dreamt up by Alicia Midland (Analytics & Optimization Team) and Kristine Horn (Engineering Team) of the WT Durham Office. The initial intent of this application is to serve as a learning tool to inform both practices how we can more easily integrate analytics alongside the development of application features. With all of this in mind, it is important to note what projects are best suited to use Amplitude:

- Organizations looking for an analytics tool that can also perform A/B testing, personalization, and acts as a customer data platform (CDP).

- Organizations looking for thought-leadership around measurement and KPIs
- Organizations who want to negotiate an MSA

It is important to collaborate with your WT Analytics & Optimization team members for more details.

## Decision

We will be using Amplitude in this project as a demonstration of it's capabilities in an E-commerce app.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

While this tool is intended for learning purposes it is good to note what projects Amplitude is not suited for:

- Organizations that are primarily interested in (app) marketing/sales analytics or attribution
- Organizations that only need product analytics, not at digital maturity for CDP/Testing, et cetera.
