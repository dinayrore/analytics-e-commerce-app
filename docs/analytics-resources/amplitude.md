# Amplitude

As per the [Expo Using Analytics](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-analytics/) documentation, Amplitude can be installed following the documentation found [here](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/typescript-react-native/). 

The React Native SDK lets you send events to [Amplitude](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-TypeScript/tree/main/packages/analytics-react-native). 

## NPM Packages

The npm package used to support Amplitude is: `@amplitude/analytics-react-native`. You must also install `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for the SDK to work as expected.
