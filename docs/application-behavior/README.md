# Application Behavior

The documents within this directory explain the features and behavior of our React Native Expo e-commerce analytics sandbox example app. In an effort to minimize overhead and maintenance, the original feature set was developed with a simplistic approach in mind. All features were "complete" - for the sake of sending analytics - within a sprints time (2 weeks). 

See [product architecture](../project-architecture/) and [architecture journal](../architecture-journal/) for details on application implementation and decision making respectively.
