# Error

As a user I want to be informed that there is an error while trying to purchase Tears of the Kingdom, because the product is unavailable at this time.

AC: 
- create error.screen.tsx ✅
- create error.styles.ts ✅
    - use application themes ✅
- avoid using packages; keep it simple ✅
    - For now, this screen is rendered when a user clicks on the Product The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, as no one can purchase the collectors editions anywhere because they are always "Sold Out".

Analytics:
 - An event is created when the user views the error screen: Error ✅
